      # execute automatic update script and log every sunday at 01:00 am
    50 00 1 * * /bin/bash -c 'cp $HOME/potentpi1/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log $HOME/potentpi1/backup_logs/apt-get-autoupdater-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).log'
      # saves monthly version of "apt-get-autoupdater.log" on the 1st of every month at 00:50 am
    51 00 1 * * rm -f $HOME/potentpi1/logs/apt-get-autoupdater.log
